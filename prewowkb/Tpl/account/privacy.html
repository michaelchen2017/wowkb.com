As permitted by law, you are also opting to receive other emails from us that may be of interest to you as a member of the WOWKB community. We may also ask you to consent to receive text message communications from us. You can manage your email and notice preferences in account settings, but note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain administrative or legal notices from us. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you transactional e-mails about your account or any services you have requested or received from us. However, you may opt out entirely of receiving any text messages – promotional, transactional or otherwise – from us.</br>

Additionally, by joining, you are agreeing to receive feedback and communications from third-parties within the Site, including third-party providers of products or services who may comment on your postings within the Site.

<h4>5. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h4>

We, and third parties we interact with, including our third party service providers, use cookies in connection with your use of the Site and third party websites (Cookies are small data files that may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our Site. We also use web beacons for similar purposes on our Site, and in HTML e-mails to our customers (e.g., to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded). In addition, we may use local shared objects (sometimes called "flash cookies"), java script, log files, and similar technologies (together with cookies and web beacons, collectively referred to as “Cookies” in this policy) to track and analyze site usage and facilitate advertising on our Site and third party sites.</br>

We may use Cookies to collect or transmit information about you and your use of the Site or third-party sites, such as: your browser type, search preferences, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, your interests on our Site and other sites, and the date and time of your use. When we use Cookies, we do so in order to further Site features and processes, provide authentication and security for your transactions on the Site, store your preferences, facilitate relevant advertising, and help us learn more about how users engage with the Site, and understand your activities after you leave our Site. Our Cookies may be persistent or stored only during an individual session.</br>

You may opt-out of tracking by third parties for certain advertising purposes (as discussed) which can help you control targeted advertising by third-parties that track your activities across sites. It may be possible to disable certain Cookies through your device or browser settings. The method for disabling cookies may vary by device and browser, but can usually be found in preferences or security settings. However, doing so may affect your ability to use the Site. If you are not comfortable with the above uses of Cookies, please do not use this Site.</br>

Do-Not-Track Signals. Please note we do not change system behavior within the Site in response to browser requests not to be tracked. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies or opting out of ad networks).</br>

Third-Party Analytics. We also use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Sites and the services we provide; you can opt out of Google Analytics and review its privacy policy here. We use these tools to gather non-personal information about users to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences. These analytics providers may use Cookies to perform their services, and may combine the information that they collect about you on our Site with other information that they have collected. This policy does not cover such third parties’ use of the data.</br>

<h4>6. Third Party Advertising.</h4>

As noted, we work with third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on third-party websites or other media, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, including Facebook, Google, and others (both Facebook and Google offer additional ways to opt out of certain advertising activities, and maintain their own privacy policies that address their interest-based advertising services). We also may work with third parties to display ads on our Site.</br>

Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested, based upon your activities on our Site and other websites. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about members, or allow them to collect certain information through our Site (e.g., IP address and demographic information), but we do not disclose your name, contact information or other personally identifiable information.</br>

You can also manage many opt-out of receiving behaviorally-targeted ads from many companies via the consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs in many countries, such as the US-based aboutads.info choices page or the EU-based http://www.youronlinechoices.com.</br>

Opting out from one or more companies listed on the respective opt out pages noted above, will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you based upon your activities on multiple websites, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies, or you subsequently delete your cookies, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the websites listed above.</br>

<h4>7. Plug-ins and Social Media Widgets.</h4>

Our Site may include social media features and widgets, such as the Facebook Like button and the "Share this" button, as well as other interactive mini-programs that run both on our Site and Services and on third-party websites, and enable certain features to work (e.g., blogs and comments). These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly and for other purposes. When these features are displayed on our Site they are hosted by third parties, and are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</br>

<h4>8. Third Party Profile Pages and Websites.</h4>

Third party businesses like home professionals or e-commerce merchants may maintain profile pages on the WOWKB Platform, and we may host websites using the WOWKB Platform for businesses using our Site Designer product. These businesses and WOWKB may collect certain information, including your communications, sent through these profile pages and websites. WOWKB’s use of information we collect is governed by this privacy policy, but third parties’ use of any information collected, or submitted by you through the WOWKB Platform, is subject to their own policies and practices, and not this privacy policy.</br>

<h4>9. Choice and Access to Your Personal Information.</h4>

You have certain choices about how to control your data, including publicly displayed profile information, communications settings, network linking, and opting out of tracking by third- parties for certain advertising purposes. These choices are described throughout this privacy policy in the relevant sections. Further, you may modify any account information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may continue to reside in our systems for a period of time, and we may maintain copies as part of our business records.</br>

<h4>10. Account Termination and Data Retention.</h4>

You can close your account at any time by going to account settings. When you close your account, you will cease to provide ongoing or future data to us. Your public profile will be deactivated. However, unless prohibited by applicable law, postings or comments you provided to the Site prior to closing your account, will remain public. We also may retain information about you for the purposes authorized under this privacy policy, including a copy of your account information as part of our business records, unless prohibited by law.</br>

<h4>11. Children.</h4>

The Site is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us at privacy@WOWKB.com, and we will take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.</br>

<h4>12. Security.</h4>

We have implemented security safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure – so we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You should take certain steps to protect your account and personal information as well, such as by choosing a strong password and keeping such password private, and logging out of your account when you are finished using it.

<h4>13. International Transfers of Personal Information.</h4>

The WOWKB group is a global organization, headquartered in the United States, with service providers, affiliates and operations in several countries. Your personal information will be transferred to and processed in the United States (or any other country where we, our affiliates, subsidiaries, agents and service providers operate) and processed there. Data protection laws differ among jurisdictions; and the United States and these other jurisdictions may not provide the same level of protection for personal information as your jurisdiction of residence. You understand that your information may be stored in or accessed from the United States and these other jurisdictions. You understand that, law enforcement agencies in the United States and these other jurisdictions may access and use your information for the purposes of investigation and law enforcement. By using our Site, you consent to the transfer and use of your information to the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as set forth in this paragraph.</br>

<h4>14. Links to Other Sites.</h4>
